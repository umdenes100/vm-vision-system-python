## Troubleshooting
There is a default camera on the computers in both labs. Sometimes it is **video0** and sometimes it's a different value.
If this is the only camera showing up, look at the following troubleshooting tips below.

<br>

### Camera is not showing up
- Click on Reset USB
- Type in `umd` and hit *Enter*
- Restart the vision system

If the camera options still do not show up:

- Unplug the usb cable for the camera
- Reboot computer
- Plug the usb cable for the camera back in
- Try starting the Vision System again and see if the camera now shows up

### My team isn't showing up on Firefox
If this is happening, verify that you have correctly wired your ESP8266 (WiFi Module)
with the correct Tx and Rx pins assigned. If the module is wired up correctly and your code
looks solid, here are some troubleshooting tips:

- Quit Firefox
- Quit out of the Vision System (red x)
- Wait a couple seconds
- Start up the Vision System again
- Start up Firefox and go to `enes100.umd.edu`

### If nothing is working and all hope is lost
Talk to a UTF/LTF/GTA! They have worked with the Vision System before and might be able to help
or point you in the right direction for help :)
